Corner Detection & Perspective Cropping
======================================

The process this file executes is based on `this jupyter notebook <https://github.com/Breta01/handwriting-ocr/blob/master/notebooks/page_detection.ipynb>`_ and `this StackOverflow answer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/44454619>`_. The `opencv package <https://docs.opencv.org/4.3.0/index.html>`_ provides most of the low-level functions. See the :ref:`Corner Crop Transform API Documentation <e2e_api_corner_crop_transform>` for details regarding the functions.
