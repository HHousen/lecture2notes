6,2017-10-23T14:26:06.000Z,63hAHbkzJG4,Three Steps to Cut Your Carbon Footprint 60% Today | Jackson Carpenter | TEDxAsheville,"Not all carbon is created equal. Writer Jackson Carpenter argues that the power to stop climate change rests on recognizing different kinds of carbon – a shift in perspective that allows us to change the world without changing our lifestyles. Jackson Carpenter has ten years’ experience working on solutions to climate change and the development of alternative fuels. He is a climate writer and member of the Collider in Asheville, NC, collaborating with scientists and businesses to address climate change. He is a coauthor of the Collider’s Business of Climate Report, and his upcoming book Carbon retells the story of climate change from a unique perspective that illuminates the commonsense solutions at our fingertips. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
